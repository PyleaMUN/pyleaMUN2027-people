Each conference has taught me something new—not only about global issues, but also about myself. Through MUN, I’ve learned how to listen, lead, and seek common ground. I truly believe MUN is one of the most valuable experiences of my life so far. As this conference has so much to offer me, I hope to give back with my enthusiasm, experience, and dedication.
Looking forward to an amazing session with all of you!</p>">

In last year's PyleaMUN I had the best time of my life as a Press team member and this year I am honored with the position of Co-ordinator of the team. I will make sure to have the best possible outcome in everything we are responsible of and my team is ready to capture every minute of this amazing conference! So, do not only prepare your speeches delegates, but your poses and smiles too!</p>
